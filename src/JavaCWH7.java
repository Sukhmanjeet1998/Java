//Why Getter and Setter.................................................................................................
// Control Over Data Access
// 1) With setters, you can add validations, such as ensuring salary is not negative
// 2) If you allow direct access (obj.salary = 5000;), any part of the program can modify it without restrictions.

//Data Encapsulation & Abstraction
// 1) By making fields private and providing public getter and setter methods, we hide the internal representation of the object.
// 2) This ensures that the internal data cannot be changed directly, reducing unintended modifications and maintaining data integrity.

//Flexibility & Maintainability
// 1) If in the future, the way salary is calculated changes (e.g., adding bonuses or deductions), you only need to modify the getter method instead of updating multiple places in your code.

//Read-Only or Write-Only Fields
// 1) If you donâ€™t want a field to be modified, you can remove the setter, making it read-only.
// 2) Similarly, if you only want to set a value but not allow retrieval, you can make it write-only by removing the getter.

// Enhancing Debugging & Logging
// 1) You can add logging inside getters and setters to track changes:

// While you can directly access fields without getters and setters, using them provides better security, control, flexibility, and maintainability. Thatâ€™s why using getter and setter methods is considered a best practice in Java. ðŸš€
